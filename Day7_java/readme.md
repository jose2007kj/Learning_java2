# [Thread Packages]
Packages are used in Java in order to prevent naming conflicts, to control access, to make searching/locating and usage of classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations easier, etc.

A Package can be defined as a grouping of related types (classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations ) providing access protection and namespace management.

Some of the existing packages in Java are −

* **java.lang:** − bundles the fundamental classes
* **java.io:** − classes for input , output functions are bundled in this package

## Documentation

You can find the React documentation [on the website](https://reactjs.org/docs).  
It is divided into several sections:

* [Quick Start](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)
* [Advanced Guides](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)
* [API Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html)
* [Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
* [Where to Get Support](https://reactjs.org/community/support.html)
* [Contributing Guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html)

You can improve it by sending pull requests to [this repository](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org).

## Examples

We have several examples [on the website](https://reactjs.org/). Here is the first one to get you started:

```jsx
class HelloMessage extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <HelloMessage name="John" />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
```

This example will render "Hello John" into a container on the page.

You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. We recommend using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) with a [React preset](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-react/) to convert JSX into native JavaScript for browsers to digest.

## Installation

React is available as the `react` package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). It is also available on a [CDN](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html).

React is flexible and can be used in a variety of projects. You can create new apps with it, but you can also gradually introduce it into an existing codebase without doing a rewrite.

The recommended way to install React depends on your project. Here you can find short guides for the most common scenarios:

* [Trying Out React](https://reactjs.org/docs/try-react.html)
* [Creating a New Application](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-new-app.html)
* [Adding React to an Existing Application](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-an-existing-app.html)
